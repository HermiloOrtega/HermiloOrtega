# 👋 Hello, I'm Hermilo Ortega — Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | IT Manager

## 🧭 About Me
I'm a full-stack software engineer with strong expertise in C#, .NET, SQL Server, and enterprise architecture. I specialize in designing and building robust, secure, and scalable systems for internal business operations — with deep hands-on experience in project ownership, stakeholder communication, and enterprise deployment.

Starting as an intern, I rapidly progressed to lead complex systems on my own, designing full-stack applications, defining data models, implementing secure access, and optimizing legacy systems across critical business domains. Today, I’m focused on developing enterprise-grade solutions that align technology with real-world business impact — and I’m ready to bring that skillset to Microsoft.
